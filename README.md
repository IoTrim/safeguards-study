# Safeguards Study

This repository contains the data and software for experimenting with Internet of Things safeguards. 
We released this with the public release of the paper "Protected or Porous: A Comparative Analysis of Threat Detection Capability of IoT Safeguards".

As discussed in Section 4 of the paper, we use threat simulation scripts that are specific to each simulated threat to reproduce the threats that the safeguards claim to detect. The scripts we use for each detectable threat is reported in the second column of the following Table (Threat Simulation) and described as follows.
